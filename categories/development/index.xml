What are we making? A good loading indicator helps users feel a sense of progress, and the spinner which Google uses for Chrome and YouTube is one of my favourites.

Whether you&amp;rsquo;re using React, Vue or Angular, these animations can be used in your app.
Why even animate things? Animations are a crucial ingredient in adding life and character to a website or application. They can make transitions feel faster even if they take more time than when they&amp;rsquo;re not animated.</description></item><item><title>Useful Sass (SCSS) media query mixins for Bootstrap</title><link>/articles/useful-sass-scss-media-query-mixins-for-bootstrap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2018 15:31:24 +1100</pubDate><guid>/articles/useful-sass-scss-media-query-mixins-for-bootstrap/</guid><description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to share some Sass (SCSS) mixins which I&amp;rsquo;ve found helpful when developing Bootstrap websites.
Whether you&amp;rsquo;re using full-blown Bootstrap or just leveraging the familiar grid they will save you time when writing repetitive media queries. Due to the similarities in naming conventions between Bootstrap 3 and 4, these mixins can be easily adapted for both versions.
They&amp;rsquo;re also versatile and work well even with your own custom naming conventions and breakpoints.</description></item><item><title>How to build custom Hugo pagination</title><link>/articles/how-to-build-custom-hugo-pagination/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2018 14:28:42 +1100</pubDate><guid>/articles/how-to-build-custom-hugo-pagination/</guid><description>Hugo is an awesome feature-packed static site generator which is also open source and free. It ships with a default pagination template but if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for full control, I&amp;rsquo;m going to demonstrate how to build custom pagination.
Introduction My focus in this tutorial is Hugo, so I won&amp;rsquo;t be writing CSS and I&amp;rsquo;ll use as little HTML as possible. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using some basic JavaScript examples to help explain Hugo&amp;rsquo;s syntax but JavaScript experience is unnecessary.</description></item><item><title>A better NBA box score</title><link>/articles/a-better-nba-box-score/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2017 09:57:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>/articles/a-better-nba-box-score/</guid><description>After seeing a ton of respected NBA Twitter people — including LeBron James — complaining about poorly designed box scores, I endeavoured to improve the existing ESPN box score with a free Chrome extension.
It&amp;rsquo;s now my favourite way to follow an NBA game. Between this, Twitter and league pass I&amp;rsquo;m all set.
Layout Using custom CSS I updated the layout of the box score page so as the two teams sit side by side.</description></item></channel></rss>
